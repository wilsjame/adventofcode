Thank you [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl) for hosting [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/events).
Head over to its [about page](https://adventofcode.com/about) to find out more!

## Notable Days 

These are some of the days that led to some interesting search
crawls. Either from curiosity to find out more or being stumped on
what to do. Usually a mix of both, but the latter absolutely being Day 19!

### Day 8: Handheld Halting
Write a parser for some assembly like boot code.

### Day 13: Shuttle Search
Use the Chinese remainder theorem to find the earliest time a set of
buses will depart at specific offsets from each other.

### Day 14: Docking Data
Bitmasking a ferry's computer system's 36-bit memory address decoding 
scheme.

### Day 18: Operation Order
Another parser, this time using the Shunting-yard algorithm to evaluate
arithmetic expressions.

### Day 19: Monster Messages
Given a context-free grammar convert it to Chomsky normal form and use
the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm to validate messages.

### Day 20: Jurassic Jigsaw
Puzzle within a puzzle! Brute force tile rearranging to find sea
monsters.

### Day 25: Combo Breaker
Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange puzzle.
